# Undergrad Internship
**----------July to End of June 2018----------**

## Description
Code removed from the main repository that I personally wrote for my internship working with members of UWE's Creative Technologies Laboratory (CT Lab) and Computer Science Research Centre (CSRC), to develop C++ audio libraries for CT Lab & CSRC's audio development board to support experimental work. 

## Repository Navigation 
### Artefacts 
Contains readme descripitons for the many different "things" I made during the internship.
### Code 
Contains the C++ classes copied across from the projects repository as of when I completed the internship.

## The Project
I worked mainly on the Arm M4 microcontroller: writing the basic audio infrastructure for an audio development board. This involved working with FAUST to develop DSP examples.

The other chip pictured on the board and codec unfortunatley had hardware faults: however, this didn't stop progress dramatically.  

The ongoing goal is to have sound synthesised out of the codec. So far MIDI can be output through the UART connection and multiple inputs can be used to design different controller interfaces.
