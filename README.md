# Undergrad Internship
**----------July to End of June 2018----------**

## Description
Code removed from the main repository that I personally wrote for my job working with members of UWE's Creative Technologies Laboratory (CT Lab) and Computer Science Research Centre (CSRC), to develop C++ audio libraries for CT Lab & CSRC's audio development board to support experimental work. 

## The Project
I worked mainly on the Arm M4 microcontroller: writing the basic infrastructure for a audio development board. 

The other chip pictured on the board and codec unfortunatley had hardware faults: however, this didn't stop progress dramatically.  

The ongoing goal is to have sound synthesised out of the codec. So far MIDI can be output through the UART connection and multiple inputs can be used to make different controller interfaces.
