# Screen Sequencer

## Description

The step sequencer from the conductive printout was also replicated on an Adafruit screen.
I only handled the midi side of things - the GUI was done by my co-worker.


The main cpp things that I contributed are esenssialy the same as the main found in the conductive printout folder.
