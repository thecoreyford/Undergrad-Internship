# Conductive Print-Out Step-Sequencer

## Description
A silver nano-particle printed controller was sent 3v. You could then read the current state of conductivity coming from different "steps" of a sequencer depending on if a washer was conducting the current across.

## Technical Notes
The inputs (A & B) were driven using transitors running off of the audio-boards dedicated 3V line.

Also, sometimes you need to hold the washers down to make sure that contact between sections of the steps is made.
